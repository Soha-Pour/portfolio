            <h1>Hi, I'm Soha</h1>
            <p>And I’m a User Experience Researcher with a <strong>passion for technology.</strong> That’s why I enrolled in a ten week <em>Intro to Programming</em> course at Epicodus code school. By the end of the course, I will have the software fluency I need to be an <strong>effective tech-based researcher</strong>. I will be able to step into the shoes of the software engineers I work with everyday. By seeing products from the perspectice of programmers, I will be a far more impactful collaborator.</p>
            <p>I've been interesed in technology for a long time. In college, I studied cognitive science - the branch of psychology concerened with memory, perception, attention, and other functions of the mind. Often times, when people design technology, they don't think much about how the end user, <strong>a human being</strong>, will use it. Through studying psychology and software engineering, I hope to bridge the gap between <strong>(wo)man and machine.</strong></p>
            <p>In my free time, I like to learn new things. Right now, I'm really interested in personal finance. When I'm not being a total nerd, I love to spend time with my family and take walks in the park near my apartment.</p>
